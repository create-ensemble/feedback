# feedback

[This][] is a collection of technology (software mostly) that was
generated as a byproduct of the development of a series improvised
musical performance pieces titled "feedback" by the [CREATE
Ensemble][] and subsequently iterated by Matt Wright, Karl Yerkes,
Christopher Jette, and others.

In this piece, each player performs with an instrument
that processes an input signal which is a mix of other players output
signals such that feedback is inevitable and central to the
performance. So far, the topology of the signal digraph is a single
ring--Each player processes the input of her immediate right (or left)
neighbor. However, many different topologies are possible (and
possibly interesting) and the one goal of the piece is to explore
changing digraph topologies during the performance.

## Usage

**Plug all of the players into the matrix mixer** such as by having
analog "hear" and "say" signals to a central multichannel digital
audio interface (or something more complicated such as jacktrip)

**Use one of the Max/MSP "Top Level" patches** (such as any `.maxpat`
inside `maxmsp/top-level-patches+history`) to implement the matrix mixer
with changeable topologies along with many other features.



## Installation

The Max patches depend on some "externals" not distributed with Max:

1. Max's third party (but maintained by a Cycling 74 employee) `shell`
external lets you execute command-line commands from Max:

2. Miller Puckette's venerable `fiddle~` external does pitch estimation;
currently maintained by Volker BÃ¶hm: <https://vboehm.net/downloads>

3. `OSC-route` from the `CNMAT Externals` package (available via Max's
built-in Package Manager).


## DONE

- This repo and this write-up
- Example instruments in Max/MSP, Puredata, and Arduino
- Matrix mixer to replace hardware/analog mixer and facilitate visualizations

## TODO

- Test matrix mixer in rehersal/performance
- Implement internal multitap delay feedback example instrument
- Implement embedded instrument (Raspberry Pi, Teensy3, iPad)
- Create visualization of piece, including graph topolgy, spectrums, levels,
  waveforms, delay time, internal feedback parameters, etc
- Explore new topologies and topology transitions in rehersal and performance
- Research methods for assessing stability and predicting attractors

## Instrument Design and Typical Characteristics

As the nature of the piece has evolved so has the description of the typical
(or desirable) instrument. Each instrument in the piece is a node in a digraph
of audio signals (and potentially metadata streams), so in order to allow
feedback, each instrument must provide a few basic affordances and each digraph
(there may be more than one) must contain at least one cycle--One way to ensure
this is to make the "out degree" of each node 1 where an out-vertex means
"listens to" or "processes" (Alternatively, you could make the "in degree" 1
where an in-vertex means "sends audio to"). Next, each node must provide some
sort of attenuation/amplification and some perceptually substantial delay.
Ideally (optionally), an instrument (or the system) shows the player the input
level and the output level of her node, but the input spectrum and the output
spectrum may be more useful visual feeback.

For the piece to remain viable, some characteristics are necessary for the
system and some characteristics are necessary for each individual node
(instrument). For instance, when the topology is a simple, single ring, at
least one instrument needs to exhibit a long delay (perceptually substantial)
so that the feedback system does not suffer from unwieldy "ringing". More
generally, any instrument that is participant in a ring (aka digraph cycle)
should exhibit a long delay. For this reason, ideally each instrument has
controllable delay time.

Each instrument may exhibit internal feedback and each instrument creator is
encouraged to internal feedback.

The system may be thought of as a [Feedback Delay Network][].
